## Introduction
Karate-Quiz is a multiple-choice karate quiz designed to help users improve their karate knowledge based on their belt level. Users can select their current belt or the next belt they are aiming for, and each belt level contains four questions that get progressively harder. This project aims to educate and engage users, providing an interactive way to test and expand karate knowledge.

### 10.  Timer
- **Description:** the timer counts down from 30 displayed during the questions to give the player motivation to answer quickly as they would need to answer quickly in a fight time is also displayed the time remaining if the player finishes the quiz before the timer ends and can be considered a secondary scoring system if two players were to both achieve the same score

## Deployment

The Karate-Quiz project was deployed online following a structured and iterative process. Below are the detailed steps taken during deployment, including code structure, testing, and optimizations.

## Deployment
Steps taken to deploy the Karate-Quiz project:

### 1. Initial Setup
- I established a clear folder structure for the project, organizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files within an "assets" directory. This helped ensure that all resources were easily accessible and maintainable, promoting a clean development environment.

### 2. HTML Structure
- Structured the HTML by incorporating essential quiz components, including the title and key buttons (start, submit, reset). I also added input placeholders to visualize the quiz layout more effectively. To facilitate JavaScript interactions, I assigned unique IDs to various `div` elements, ensuring they could be easily targeted in my scripts.

### 3. Styling the Quiz
- After building the HTML structure, I implemented basic CSS styling, choosing colors and fonts that aligned with the quiz's theme. I prioritized responsive design principles to ensure the quiz displayed well on various screen sizes, using media queries to adjust styles accordingly.

### 4. Question Implementation
- Compiled four questions for each belt level in a Word document, ensuring they were well-structured. I then transferred these questions into the JavaScript file, categorizing them by belt color. Initially, I experimented with a lettered multiple-choice format (A, B, C, D), but later simplified it by directly including the correct answer as the selectable option. This approach streamlined the testing process.

### 5. Connecting Code
- Using various YouTube tutorials and W3Schools resources for guidance on JavaScript functionality, I integrated my JavaScript code with the HTML structure and CSS styles. This process involved creating functions to manage quiz logic, handle user interactions, and dynamically update the HTML based on user input.

### 6. Code Cleanup
- After implementing the core functionality, I conducted a thorough code review to refine my scripts. I removed redundant code generated during experimentation and reorganized the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to enhance readability and maintainability.

### 7. Deployment
Github Deployment
1.	Log in to your GitHub account. navigate to https://github.com/FinnbarrAmbrose/Karate-Quiz.git
2.	You can set up your own repository and copy or clone it.
3.	git add, git commit and git push to a GitHub repository, if necessary.
4.	GitHub pages will update from the master branch by default.
5.	Go to the Settings page of the repository.
6.	Scroll down to the Github Pages section.
7.	Select the Master Branch as the source and Confirm the selection.
8.	Wait a minute or two and it should be live for viewing. 

### 8. Implementing Feedback
- Following feedback from my mentor, I successfully deployed the Karate-Quiz program online using GitHub Pages. To optimize the siteâ€™s performance, I refined my code by targeting specific functions rather than relying on generic header functions (removing these from all sections except the footer). This approach created a more consistent and efficient styling method by applying styles directly to IDs and classes.
- I validated the HTML and CSS using W3C Validator tools. While I resolved most issues, one persistent warning related to the flexbox display remained. Changing it to `flex` produced an undesirable layout, so I maintained the current setup for visual consistency.
- Based on my mentor's advice, I added a timer configured for 30 seconds to enhance user engagement and streamline testing. Instead of using pop-up alerts, I set up alert messages directly on the page for a smoother user experience. These alerts now cover scenarios where a belt is not selected at quiz start, an answer is not chosen before submission, and when the timer expires.
- further improvements I made were removing the question and options at the end of the quiz leaving only the score time remaining and reset button this was to ensure that the player would recognise that the quiz ended rather than allow them to keep pressing buttons that wouldn't do anything
- change the buttons from a blue to a black to match the background which displays a black belt with a white guy this was mainly done to improved the accessibility in my lighthouse score 

### 9. Further Improvements
- I identified opportunities for further optimization in my JavaScript code, particularly by refining the belt selection logic. By replacing the existing `else if` statements with a more efficient method (e.g., `currentBeltQuestions`), I aimed to improve processing speed and overall site performance.

### Future Improvements
- Adding images to questions for better visual engagement.
- Improving the background image quality (current limitation: finding a larger image for free use).
- Expanding the question database to include more topics.
- Incorporating picture-based questions and answers.
- Displaying results with correct and incorrect answers at the end of the quiz for further learning.
- Highlighting correct answers for any questions answered incorrectly.
